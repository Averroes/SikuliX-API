SikuliX-API
===========

**Current version: 1.0 Beta500 (branch master)** --- [click for downloadable packages](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API/wiki/Packages)

Sikuli's Java API supporting visual testing and automation (currently using JNI/C++ to integrate with OpenCV and Tesseract)

SikuliX-API is targeted at people who want to develop, run and debug programs in Java, other Java based languages or Java aware scripting languages currently not supported by SikuliX-IDE (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-IDE).

Same goes for people who want to develop, run and debug scripts using SikuliX-IDE supported scripting languages in other IDE's like Eclipse, Netbeans, ... 
<br /><br />
The downloadable packages of SikuliX-API contain everything needed to develop, test, run and debug with any suitable IDE (e.g. Eclipse, Netbeans, ...) or however you like ;-).
<br /><br />
If new to Sikuli, you might aternatively be interested in the pure Java implementation, which is to some extent feature compatible, but not API compatible, called Sikuli Java API (http://code.google.com/p/sikuli-api).

**History**
 - this is based on the developement at MIT (Tsung-Hsiang Chang (Sean aka vgod) and Tom Yeh) which was discontinued end 2011 (https://github.com/sikuli/sikuli) with a latest version called Sikuli X-1.0r930 (http://www.sikuli.org).
 - and the follow up repo https://github.com/RaiMan/Sikuli12.11, where I prepared the creation of a final version 1.0
 - in April 2013 I decided, to divide Sikuli X into the 2 packages SikuliX-IDE (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-IDE) and SikuliX-API (this repo), to better support future contributions.

**Support**
